This is a chalange project build on create react app.

To start the app run these steps:
- npm install
- npm start

If you want to try production build run:
- npm install(if it was not run before)
- npm run build
- npm install -g serve
- serve -s build

I hope I managed to code enough of the prject so you can see my skills.
From start I wanned to show nice app that uses React, Typescript, Redux and others. Later due to lack of time I needed to do some compromises so I could finish project in time.
I managed to finish almost all, but I'm missing possibility to move multiple cards in a cascade.
With JSON I/O I am not sure if I understood correctly what is required, because I'm used to manipulate with data through API. I've chosen to add possibility to use preloaded shuffle for cards from file and enabled user to download his score after game is finished.

As I've said I had to do some compromises due to time and there is a lot that could have been better if I had more time.
Examples of enhancements:
- responsibility 
- use components and container to separate graphics and connection to store
- add proper theme and theme provider to styled components
- proper use of types
- localizations
- performance enhancements(Memo, PureComponents, reselct...)
- better written utils
- graphics(even it was not required)

What could have been added:
- counter
- time
- undo(history)
- possibility to choose from pre loaded shuffles
